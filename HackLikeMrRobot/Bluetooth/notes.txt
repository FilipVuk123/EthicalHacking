$ sudo hciconfig hci0 up

$ sudo hcitool scan // looking for other bt devices

$ sudo hcitool inq // gives more information: classes... that's the key

Multiblue dongle - device that can act as a keyboard - used in the show (flashed with a keyboard BT class). Its basically a keyboard

$ sudo apt install spooftooph // to spoof a bluetooth device, spoof a mac address 

$ sudo spooftooph -i hci0 -a <multiblue tongles MAC> -n test // spooofing a BT and naming it test. 


Now the Multiblue dongle can be used as bluetooth keyboard - making the laptop belive that that is the device its already connected to (skipping pairing of the devices). 
Now that he is connected to the laptop - he controlles the prision system
Now you just type the exploit (which is a little bit unrealistic since he cannot see what he is typing...)
