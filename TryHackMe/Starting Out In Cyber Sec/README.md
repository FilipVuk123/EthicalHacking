# Offensive Security

The first large area within Cyber Security is the offensive side. This area involves attacking different applications and technologies to discover vulnerabilities.

This career is for you if:

    you enjoy understanding how things work
    you are analytical
    you like thinking out of the box

The most common offensive security job role is a penetration tester. A penetration tester is an individual that is legally employed by an organisation to find vulnerabilities in their products. A penetration tester usually requires a broad range of knowledge including:

    web application security
    network security
    use of programming languages to write various scripts

# Defensive Security

This is the second major area within Security. While Offensive Security involves actively finding vulnerabilities and misconfigurations within technologies, Defensive Security involves detecting and stopping these attacks.

This career track is for you if:

    you are analytical
    you enjoy problem solving

One of the careers under this track is a Security Analyst. This is an individual in an organisation who's job is to monitor various systems in the organisation and detect whether any of these systems are being attacked. To do this, you need to understand how underlying technologies work and then understand what attacks against these technologies look like

While a Security Analyst deals with detecting attacks, an Incident Responder is usually brought in once an attack has already occurred. Their main responsibilities include understanding what actions an attacker has taken in the organisation and what the impact of their actions will be. Incident Responders also need to know how underlying technologies work and what potential attacks could be carried out against a system

While this is a very specialist role, malware analysis is quite common when detecting and responding to attacks. Malicious actors would use malicious pieces of software in any stage of their attack cycle from gaining access to a system to maintaining persistence. If you can understand what exactly this malware is doing, you can prevent further abuse and also identify the malicious action.
