PE files:
    Portable executable
        Structure: headers + sections... => metadata + data (https://github.com/corkami/pics/blob/master/binary/pe101/README.md)

        use pe bear to load exe files and see that structure - most important things: .rtext, .rdata, .rsrc
        or use dumpbin in cli: $ dumpbin /headers c:\windows\system32\calc.exe 




    Generating exe vc dll:
        exe vs dynamic-link library 
        

        $ rundll32 implant.dll,RunME

        use Proces Hacker to see the running processes 


Droppers:

    Program that will deliver the payload to a victim

    can be javascript, powershell (or even .exe)

    Where to store the payload?
        1) .text - put the payload into main function (02.Payload_Storage/01.implant.text)
        2) .data - read only -> create a global variable holding the payload (02.Payload_Storage/01.implant.data)
        3) .rsrc - create a small file that holds the payload 
                    -> tell the compiler that theat file is the part of the resources section 
                    -> use specific API calls that extracts the payload (02.Payload_Storage/01.implant.rsrc)
